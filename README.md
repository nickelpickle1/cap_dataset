# cap_dataset
This is a synthetic (but realistic) dataset for mixed-integer channel assignment problems (CAP), depicting the received signal strength (in watts) between transmitting radios (rows) and receiving radios (columns).  The radios are divided into 118 units, of 4 to 30 radios each.  It is assumed that radios within a unit will be communicating with each other, while any radio transmissions outside of a unit will be considered interference.
Twenty different timesteps (TS) are considered.  The data was generated by simulating radio propagation over rough terrain.  Only one channel (frequency band) is considered, but others could be simulated by skewing the received signal strength values.
